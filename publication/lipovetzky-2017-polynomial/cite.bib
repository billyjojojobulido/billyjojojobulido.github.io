 abstract = {It has been shown recently that heuristic and width-based search can be combined to produce planning algorithms with a performance that goes beyond the state-of-the-art. Such algorithms are based on best-first width search (BFWS), a plain best-first search set with evaluations functions combined lexicographically to break ties, some of which express novelty based preferences. In BFWS (f5), for example, the evaluation function f5 weights nodes by a novelty measure, breaking ties by the number of non-achieved goals. BFWS (f5) is a best-first algorithm, and hence, it is complete but not polynomial, and its performance doesnâ€™t match the state of the art. In this work we show, however, that incomplete versions of BFWS (f5) where nodes with novelty greater than k are pruned, are not only polynomial but have an empirical performance that is better than both BFWS (f5) and state-of-the-art planners. This is shown by considering all the international planning competition instances. This is the first time where polynomial algorithms with meaningful bounds are shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in planning. Practical and theoretical implications of this empirical finding are briefly sketched.},
