 abstract = {The aim of decentralised multi-agent (DMA) planning is to coordinate a set of agents to jointly achieve a goal while preserving their privacy. Blind search algorithms, such as width-based search, have recently proved to be very effective in the context of centralised automated planning, especially when combined with goal-oriented techniques. In this paper, we discuss a recent line of research in which the usage of width-based search has been extensively studied in the context of DMA planning, addressing the challenges related to the agents' privacy and performance.},
