 abstract = {Based on archaeological evidence from Kutch-Saurashtra (N Gujarat, NW India), we use Agent-Based
Modelling (ABM) to explore the persistence of hunter-gatherer (HG) groups in semi-arid environments
in the mid and late Holocene. Agents interact within a realistic semi-arid environment dominated by
the monsoon. Precipitation trends are modelled from instrumental records (1871 - 2008) calibrated with
existing models for the Asian monsoon in the Holocene (c. 12 ka - present). Experiments aim at
exploring dependencies between population dynamics and climate-driven environmental change (in
terms of resource availability) for precipitation patterns at the local, regional and continental scales.
Resources are distributed across a simplified ground-model. Average yearly precipitation (AYP, i.e.
mean) and variance in yearly precipitation (VYP, i.e. standard deviation) are the main parameters
affecting resource availability in the simulations. We assess the effects of environmental change on HG
populations at different time-scales: (1) Patterns of seasonal (inter-annual) resource availability, (2)
Effects of changes in mean precipitation trends over the long (Pleistocene-Holocene) and the mid
(Holocene, millennial) periods, and (3) Effects of intra-annual precipitation variability, i.e. changes in
standard deviation from mean precipitation trends over the short period (annual to decadal).
Simulations show that: (1) Strong seasonality is coherent with the persistence of HG populations in
India, independently of the geographical scale of the precipitation models, (2) Changes in AYP over
the mid period (Holocene) are not sufficient to explain the disappearance of HG populations in KutchSaurashtra (K-S) 4 ka, (3) Precipitation variability (VYP) over the short period (annual to decadal) is
the main parameter affecting population performance and overall ecosystem dynamics. To date,
sufficiently refined palaeo-climatic records do not exist for the study area, but higher VYP values 4 ka
do not exclude the possibility that other factors may have driven the disappearance of HG populations
in Kutch-Saurashtra. },
