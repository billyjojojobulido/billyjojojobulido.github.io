 abstract = {Goal recognition has been extensively studied by AI researchers, but most algorithms take only observed actions as input. Here we argue that the time taken to carry out these actions provides an additional signal that supports goal recognition. We present a behavioral experiment confirming that people use timing information in this way, and develop and evaluate a goal recognition algorithm that is sensitive to both actions and timing information. Our results suggest that existing goal recognition algorithms can be improved by incorporating a model of planning time on both synthetic data and human data, and that these improvements can be substantial in scenarios in which relatively few actions have been observed.},
