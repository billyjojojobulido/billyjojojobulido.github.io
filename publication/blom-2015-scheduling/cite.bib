 abstract = {In open-pit mining operations, there are several levels
of planning, each of which passes down restrictions to
the level below. Each planning task is to determine the
order in which material should be mined and how it
should be processed, such that blending and utilisation
targets are met. The mining operations are subject to
various constraints on equipment use, maintenance and
other resources. In this paper, we present a demo for
two levels of planning: short-term scheduling and operations planning. The short-term schedule determines
the blocks which should be mined, and when. The operational planners have the task of enacting the plans at a
finer time horizon. Our system computes a set of schedules that can then be visualised in the form of tables,
charts, and maps to support human expert planners.},
