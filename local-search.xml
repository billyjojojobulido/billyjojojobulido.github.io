    Scavenger-Hunt Online Game App (SOGA) is a game application developed based on Android. Team members are students from the COMP90018 Mobile Computing Systems Programming course at the University of Melbourne. Project Introduction: SOGA is an Android App for creating, sharing, and playing scavenger hunts of your own design. This game is designed for people to go hiking outdoors or explore the city while playing the game. In this app, there are a range of predefined options that users can choose to join in, such as Melbourne City Hunt. During the game, users can guess the target location through the hints of the current level. After the user reaches the target location, the user can complete the level task and start the next level after passing the task. Once finishing, the game history will be stored. Apart from predefined games, users are able to create their own game by selecting sites and choosing tasks at each site. In your customized game, call your friends to join the game and compete together. In the process of playing games, the purpose of socialization and exploration is achieved. Project Demo Video Key Technologies: Android Studio, Java, Firebase Database & Authentication, Google Maps APIs. Key Features: User management - The app allows users to register and log in to the app. All authentication information is supported and stored in the Firebase Authentication Server. Home page - In the Home page, there are a number of functionalities, including joining a featured or predefined hunt game, creating a hunt game by yourself, joining a customized hunt game, checking hunt game history, and logging out. All configuration data is stored in the Firebase Database. Game page - During the hunt game, the app uses Google Maps API to track the userâ€™s location. Once arriving at the correct site, the user must finish a small task before going to the next site. Tasks include: Hold the phone for 30 seconds, Spin in place 10 times, Jump 10 times. All tasks are accomplished through the phoneâ€™s built-in sensors. Acknowledgement: I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the contributors to this project. Particularly in this project, everyone on the team takes responsibilities and development tasks equally, so contributors are listed below in alphabetical order only (without role specification).

    Abstract: Smart contracts, an innovative technology in Blockchain 2.0, allow the same program (business logic) to run on multiple nodes for consistent results. While widely used in systems like Ethereum, smart contracts can be vulnerable due to bugs, and their immutability means any errors become permanent, potentially causing significant economic loss. To prevent this, vulnerability detection before deployment is crucial, and various analysis tools have emerged for security assurance. However, the quality of these tools varies, and systematic quality assessments are lacking. Our research aims to fill this gap by systematically evaluating existing smart contract analysis tools. Keywords: Evaluation, Smart Contracts, Vulnerability, Solidity, Analysis Tools. Unfortunately, my presentation at the conference was not recorded, but a backup presentation was uploaded. I also delivered a public talk at the Ethereum Engineering Group Meet-up, thanks to Dr. Peter Robinson from the University of Queensland, where I discussed this research into smart contract vulnerability analysis tools. The PDF of the slides is available. ENASE (Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering) is an international forum to discuss and publish research findings related to novel approaches in software engineering, particularly in evolving computing paradigms. ENASE 2023 was held in Prague, Czech Republic, from 24-25 April 2023. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Shiping Chen, for his patient guidance, and to Dr. Dong Yuan, Dr. Yan Liu, and Dr. Peter Robinson for their valuable insights. Lastly, I am deeply grateful to my family and friends for their support during my studies.
