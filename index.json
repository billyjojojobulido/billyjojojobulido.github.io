We explore the extent to which modern planners from the field of AI can account for human performance on the Tower of London (TOL) task, a close relative of the Tower of Hanoi problem that has been extensively studied by psychologists. We characterize the task using the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and evaluate an adaptive online planner and a family of well-known planners, including online planners, optimal planners and satisficing planners. Each planner is evaluated based on its ability to predict the actions and planning times of participants in a new behavioral experiment. Our results suggest that participants use a range of strategies but that an adaptive lookahead planner provides the best overall account of both human actions and human planning times. This finding is consistent with the view that humans differ from standard AI planners by integrating a mechanism for evidence accumulation.","tags":[],"title":"Comparing AI Planning Algorithms with Humans on the Tower of London Task","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chao Lei","Nir Lipovetzky","Ehinger Krista"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1689379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685533532,"objectID":"25c46c8116a7dc847dc166fd99ee2f33","permalink":"https://nirlipo.github.io/publication/chao-2023-gpp/","publishdate":"2023-05-31T11:45:32.146933Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chao-2023-gpp/","section":"publication","summary":"It has been shown recently that successful techniques in classical planning, such as goal-oriented heuristics and landmarks, can improve the ability to compute planning programs for generalized planning (GP) problems. In this work, we introduce the notion of action novelty rank, which computes novelty with respect to a planning program, and propose novelty-based generalized planning solvers, which prune a newly generated planning program if its most frequent action repetition is greater than a given bound $v$, implemented by novelty-based best-first search BFS(v) and its progressive variant PGP(v). Besides, we introduce lifted helpful actions in GP derived from action schemes, and propose new evaluation functions and structural program restrictions to scale up the search. Our experiments show that the new algorithms BFS(v) and PGP(v) outperform the state-of-the-art in GP over the standard generalized planning benchmarks.

Most existing works solve multi-agent epistemic planning problems by either pre-compiling them into classical planning problems; or, using explicit actions and their effects to encode Kripke-based semantics.  A recent approach called Planning with Perspectives (PWP) delegates epistemic reasoning in planning to external functions using F-STRIPS, keeping the search within the planning algorithm and lazily evaluating epistemic formulae. Although PWP is expressive and efficient, it models S5 epistemic logic and does not support belief, including false belief.  In this paper, we extend the PWP model to handle multi-agent belief by following the intuition that agents believe something they have seen until they see otherwise. We call this justified perspectives. We formalise this notion of multi-agent belief based on the definition of knowledge in PWP. Using experiments on existing epistemic and doxastic planning benchmarks, we show that our belief planner can solve benchmarks more efficiently than the state-of-the-art baseline, and can model some problems that are infeasible to model using propositional-based approaches.","tags":[],"title":"Planning with Multi-agent Belief Using Justified Perspectives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elena M.

To address these challenges, we formulate a set-wise preference learning problem, and validate a cost function that captures human group preferences for complex collaborative robotic tasks (cobotics). We develop a sparse optimization formulation to introduce a distinctiveness metric that aggregates individuals with similar preference profiles. Analysis of anonymized unlabelled preferences provides further insight into group preferences. Identification of the mode average most-preferred meta-behavior and minimum covariance bound allows us to analyze group cohesion.

For preserving the agents' privacy, agents jointly compute a plan that achieves mutual goals by keeping certain information private to the individual agents. Unfortunately, this can severely restrict the accuracy of the heuristic functions used while searching for solutions. It has been recently shown that, for centralized planning, blind search algorithms such as width-based search can solve instances of many existing domains in low polynomial time when they feature atomic goals. Moreover, the performance of goal-oriented search can be improved by combining it with width-based search. In this paper, we investigate the usage of width-based search in the context of (decentralised) collaborative multi-agent privacy-preserving planning, addressing the challenges related to the agents' privacy and performance. In particular, we show that width-based search is a very effective approach over several benchmark domains, even when the search is driven by heuristics that roughly estimate the distance from goal states, computed without using the private information of other involved agents. Moreover, we show that the use of width-based techniques can significantly reduce the number of messages transmitted among the agents, better preserving their privacy and improving their performance. An experimental study presented in the paper analyses the effectiveness of our techniques, and compares them with the state-of-the-art of collaborative multi-agent planning.","tags":[],"title":"Width-Based Search for Multi Agent Privacy-Preserving Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Farm.bot is an open-source 3-axis cartesian robot.

A common assumption of GR is that the underlying environment is stationary. However, in many real-world scenarios, it is necessary to recognize agents' goals over extended periods. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the environment will change throughout a series of goal recognition tasks. This paper introduces the problem of continuous GR over a changing environment. The solution to this problem is a GR system capable of recognizing agents' goals over an extended period where the environment in which the agents operate changes. To support the evaluation of candidate solutions to this new GR problem, in this paper, we present the Goal Recognition Amidst Changing Environments (GRACE) tool for generating instances of the new problem. Specifically, the tool can be configured to generate GR problems that account for different environmental changes and drifts. GRACE can generate a series of modified environments over discrete time steps and the data induced by agents operating in the environment while completing different goals.","tags":[],"title":"GRACE: A Simulator for Continuous Goal Recognition over Changing Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sigfredo Fuentes","Ranjith R Unnithan","Eden Tongson","Nir Lipovetzky"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678863201,"objectID":"86bec7bccd83185d72c1a380f297ed25","permalink":"https://nirlipo.github.io/publication/fuentes-2022-implementation/","publishdate":"2023-03-15T06:53:21.848278Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fuentes-2022-implementation/","section":"publication","summary":"The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI), together with robotics, sensors, sensor networks, Internet of Things (IoT), and machine/deep learning modeling, has reached the forefront of research activities, moving towards the goal of increasing the efficiency in a multitude of applications and purposes related to environmental sciences.

Epistemic planning — planning with knowledge and belief — is essential in many multi-agent and human-agent interaction domains. Most state-of-the-art epistemic planners solve epistemic planning problems by either compiling to propositional classical planning (for example, generating all possible knowledge atoms or compiling epistemic formulae to normal forms); or explicitly encoding Kripke-based semantics. However, these methods become computationally infeasible as problem sizes grow. In this paper, we decompose epistemic planning by delegating reasoning about epistemic formulae to an external solver. We do this by modelling the problem using Functional STRIPS, which is more expressive than standard STRIPS and supports the use of external, black-box functions within action models. Building on recent work that demonstrates the relationship between what an agent ‘sees’ and what it knows, we define the perspective of each agent using an external function, and build a solver for epistemic logic around this. Modellers can customise the perspective function of agents, allowing new epistemic logics to be defined without changing the planner. We ran evaluations on well-known epistemic planning benchmarks to compare an existing state-of-the-art planner, and on new scenarios that demonstrate the expressiveness of the PWP approach. The results show that our PWP planner scales significantly better than the state-of-the-art planner that we compared against, and can express problems more succinctly.","tags":[],"title":"Planning with Perspectives--Decomposing Epistemic Planning using Functional STRIPS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefan O'Toole","Miquel Ramirez","Nir Lipovetzky","Adrian R Pearce"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678863201,"objectID":"7390b3d5b61ad659245242db64d51670","permalink":"https://nirlipo.github.io/publication/o-2022-sampling/","publishdate":"2023-03-15T06:53:21.790657Z","relpermalink":"/publication/o-2022-sampling/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce a new algorithm, Regression based Supervised Learning (RSL), for learning per instance Neural Network (NN) defined heuristic functions for classical planning problems.

In this paper, we propose a framework for solving the probabilistic goal recognition problem using process mining techniques for discovering models that describe the observed behavior and diagnosing deviations between the discovered models and observations. The framework imitates the principles of observational learning, one of the core mechanisms of social learning exhibited by humans, and relaxes the above assumptions. It has been implemented in a publicly available tool.

AI planning is model-based: a planning system takes as input a description (or model) of the initial situation, the actions available to change it, and the goal condition to output a plan composed of those actions that will accomplish the goal when executed from the initial situation.  \n\n The Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is a formal knowledge representation language designed to express planning models. Developed by the planning research community as a means of facilitating systems comparison, it has become a de-facto standard input language of many planning systems, although it is not the only modelling language for planning. Several variants of PDDL have emerged that capture planning problems of different natures and complexities, with a focus on deterministic problems.  \n\n The purpose of this book is two-fold. First, we present a unified and current account of PDDL, covering the subsets of PDDL that express discrete, numeric, temporal, and hybrid planning. Second, we want to introduce readers to the art of modelling planning problems in this language, through educational examples that demonstrate how PDDL is used to model realistic planning problems. The book is intended for advanced students and researchers in AI who want to dive into the mechanics of AI planning, as well as those who want to be able to use AI planning systems without an in-depth explanation of the algorithms and implementation techniques they use.  \n\n Table of Contents: Praise for *An Introduction to the Planning Domain Definition Language / Preface / Introduction / Discrete and Deterministic Planning / More Expressive Classical Planning / Numeric Planning / Temporal Planning / Planning with Hybrid Systems / Conclusion / Bibliography / Authors' Biographies / Index*  ","tags":["Teaching","AI Planning","PDDL","Modeling"],"title":"An introduction to the planning domain definition language","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alfonso E Gerevini","Nir Lipovetzky","Francesco Percassi","Alessandro Saetti","Ivan Serina"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"1629f3bcea0f9d7e7ce2b5d4ab3c9ca4","permalink":"https://nirlipo.github.io/publication/gerevini-2019-best/","publishdate":"2020-07-26T09:42:49.127576Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gerevini-2019-best/","section":"publication","summary":"In multi-agent planning, preserving the agents’ privacy has become an increasingly popular research topic. For preserving the agents’ privacy, agents jointly compute a plan that achieves mutual goals by keeping certain information private to the individual agents. Unfortunately, this can severely restrict the accuracy of the heuristic functions used while searching for solutions. It has been recently shown that, for centralized planning, the performance of goal oriented search can be improved by combining goal oriented search and width-based search. The combination of these techniques has been called best-first width search.

Most state-of-the-art epistemic planners solve this problem by compiling to propositional classical planning, for example, generating all possible knowledge atoms, or compiling epistemic formula to normal forms. However, these methods become computationally infeasible as problems grow. In this paper, we decompose epistemic planning by delegating reasoning about epistemic formula to an external solver. We do this by modelling the problem usingemph functional STRIPS, which is more expressive than standard STRIPS and supports the use of external, black-box functions within action models. Exploiting recent work that demonstrates the relationship between what an agentsees' and what it knows, we allow modellers to provide new implementations of externals functions. These define what agents see in their environment, allowing new epistemic logics to be defined without changing the planner. As a result, it increases the capability and flexibility of the epistemic model itself, and avoids the exponential pre-compilation step. We ran evaluations on well-known epistemic planning benchmarks to compare with an existing state-of-the-art planner, and on new scenarios based on different external functions. The results show that our planner scales significantly better than the state-of-the-art planner against which we compared, and can express problems more succinctly.","tags":null,"title":"What you get is what you see: Decomposing Epistemic Planning using Functional STRIPS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefan O’Toole","Miquel Ramirez","Nir Lipovetzky","Adrian Pearce"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"f865b9f63481867ca20facfb552ca793","permalink":"https://nirlipo.github.io/publication/o-2019-width/","publishdate":"2020-07-26T09:42:49.13031Z","relpermalink":"/publication/o-2019-width/","section":"publication","summary":"Sequential decision problems for real-world applications often need to be solved in real-time, requiring algorithms to perform well with a restricted computational budget.

We formally define and model these tasks as Goal POMDPs where the state space is the Cartesian product of the states of the world and a given set of hypothetical goals. Action effects are deterministic in the world states of the problem but probabilistic in the observer’s beliefs. Transition probabilities are obtained from making a call to a model–based plan recognition algorithm, which we refer to as an observer stereotype. We propose an action selection strategy via on–line planning that seeks actions to quickly convey the goal being pursued to an observer assumed to fit a given stereotype. In order to keep run–times feasible, we propose a novel model–based plan recognition algorithm that approximates well–known probabilistic plan recognition methods. The resulting on–line planner, after being evaluated over a diverse set of domains and three different observer stereotypes, is found to convey goal information faster than purely goal–directed planners.","tags":null,"title":"Action Selection for Transparent Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guillem Frances","Hector Geffner","Nir Lipovetzky","Miquel Ramırez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"84cb46fafc984334ba3eb58c5bf6cb8e","permalink":"https://nirlipo.github.io/publication/frances-2018-best/","publishdate":"2020-07-26T09:42:49.117206Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frances-2018-best/","section":"publication","summary":"Width-based search algorithms have recently emerged as a simple yet effective approach to planning.

Classical planners, however, deal only with classical problems that can be expressed in declarative planning languages such as STRIPS or PDDL. This prevents their use on problems that are not easy to model declaratively or whose dynamics are given via simulations. Simulators do not provide a declarative representation of actions, but simply return successor states. The question we address in this paper is: can a planner that has access to the structure of states and goals only, approach the performance of planners that also have access to the structure of actions expressed in PDDL? To answer this, we develop domain-independent, black box planning algorithms that completely ignore action structure, and show that they match the performance of state-of-the-art classical planners on the standard planning benchmarks. Effective black box algorithms open up new possibilities for modeling and for expressing control knowledge, which we also illustrate.","tags":null,"title":"Purely Declarative Action Representations are Overrated: Classical Planning with Simulators","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miquel Ramirez","Michael Papasimeon","Lyndon Benke","Nir Lipovetzky","Tim Miller","Adrian R Pearce"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"5d35f66afffc799de0a5cffb406e6630","permalink":"https://nirlipo.github.io/publication/ramirez-2017-real/","publishdate":"2020-07-26T09:42:49.112552Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ramirez-2017-real/","section":"publication","summary":"The automatic generation of realistic behaviour such as tactical intercepts for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in air combat is a challenging problem.

Agents interact within a realistic semi-arid environment dominated by the monsoon. Precipitation trends are modelled from instrumental records (1871 - 2008) calibrated with existing models for the Asian monsoon in the Holocene (c. 12 ka - present). Experiments aim at exploring dependencies between population dynamics and climate-driven environmental change (in terms of resource availability) for precipitation patterns at the local, regional and continental scales. Resources are distributed across a simplified ground-model. Average yearly precipitation (AYP, i.e. mean) and variance in yearly precipitation (VYP, i.e. standard deviation) are the main parameters affecting resource availability in the simulations. We assess the effects of environmental change on HG populations at different time-scales: (1) Patterns of seasonal (inter-annual) resource availability, (2) Effects of changes in mean precipitation trends over the long (Pleistocene-Holocene) and the mid (Holocene, millennial) periods, and (3) Effects of intra-annual precipitation variability, i.e. changes in standard deviation from mean precipitation trends over the short period (annual to decadal). Simulations show that: (1) Strong seasonality is coherent with the persistence of HG populations in India, independently of the geographical scale of the precipitation models, (2) Changes in AYP over the mid period (Holocene) are not sufficient to explain the disappearance of HG populations in KutchSaurashtra (K-S) 4 ka, (3) Precipitation variability (VYP) over the short period (annual to decadal) is the main parameter affecting population performance and overall ecosystem dynamics.

In this paper, we address the problem of finding feasible sequences using a combined MIP and planning based decomposition approach. The MIP takes care of the resource constraints, and the planner solves the remaining sequence problem. We extend the notion of finding feasible sequences to finding good feasible sequences, by devising a heuristic objective function in the MIP, which improves the resulting search space for the planner. We empirically analyse the scalability of our approach on a benchmark data set, before demonstrating its effectiveness on a real world case study provided by our industry partner.

We show that many benchmark domains have a bounded and small width provided that goals are restricted to single atoms, and hence that such problems are provably solvable in low polynomial time. We then focus on the practical value of these ideas over the existing benchmarks which feature conjunctive goals. We show that the blind-search procedure can be used for both serializing the goal into subgoals and for solving the resulting problems, resulting in a ‘blind’ planner that competes well with a best-first search planner guided by state-of-the-art heuristics. In addition, ideas like helpful actions and landmarks can be integrated as well, producing a planner with state-of-the-art performance.","tags":null,"title":"Width and serialization of classical planning problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabio Patrizi","Nir Lipoveztky","Giuseppe De Giacomo","Hector Geffner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"af7772d91ea0fcb7bf07a93e1a86719f","permalink":"https://nirlipo.github.io/publication/patrizi-2011-computing/","publishdate":"2020-07-26T09:42:49.081203Z","relpermalink":"/publication/patrizi-2011-computing/","section":"publication","summary":"Classical planning has been notably successful in synthesizing finite plans to achieve states where propositional goals hold. In the last few years, classical planning has also been extended to incorporate temporally extended goals, expressed in temporal logics such as LTL, to impose restrictions on the state sequences generated by finite plans. In this work, we take the next step and consider the computation of infinite plans for achieving arbitrary LTL goals. We show that infinite plans can also be obtained efficiently by calling a classical planner once over a classical planning encoding that represents and extends the composition of the planning domain and the Buchi automaton representing the goal.

The basic idea behind these planners is to search for plans using a search algorithm guided by heuristic estimators derived automatically from the problem (McDermott 1996; Bonet and Geffner 2001). State-of-the-art planners, however, go well beyond this idea, adding a number of techniques that are specific to planning. These techniques, such as helpful actions and landmarks (Hoffmann and Nebel 2001; Hoffmann, Porteous, and Sebastia 2004; Richter, Helmert, and Westphal 2008), are designed to exploit the propositional structure of planning problems; a structure that is absent in traditional heuristic search where states and heuristic evaluations are used as black boxes. Moreover, new search algorithms have been devised to make use of these techniques. FF, for example, triggers a best-first search when an incomplete but effective greedy search (enforced hill climbing) that uses helpful actions only, fails. In FD and LAMA, the use of helpful or preferred operators is not restricted to the first phase of the search, but to one of the open lists maintained in a multi-queue search algorithm. In both cases, dual search architectures that appeal either to two successive searches or to a single search with multiple open lists, are aimed at solving fast, large problems that are simple, without giving up completeness on problems that are not.","tags":null,"title":"Searching with probes: The classical planner probe","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nir Lipovetzky","Héctor Geffner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"ef95a95b0d869b3661eb074731e7994e","permalink":"https://nirlipo.github.io/publication/lipovetzky-2009-inference/","publishdate":"2020-07-26T09:42:49.072443Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lipovetzky-2009-inference/","section":"publication","summary":"Current state-of-the-art planners solve problems, easy and hard alike, by search, expanding hundreds or thousands of nodes. Yet, given the ability of people to solve easy problems and to explain their solutions, it seems that an essential inferential component may be missing. The reasons expressed by people for selecting actions appear to be related to causal chains: sequences of causal links a i→ p i+ 1, i= 0,..., n–1, such that a 0 is applicable in the current state, p i is a precondition of action a i, and p n is a goal. Some of these causal chains or paths appear to be good, some bad, others appear to be impossible. In this work, we focus on such paths and develop three techniques for performing inference over them from which a path-based planner is obtained. We define the conditions under which a path is consistent, provide an heuristic estimate of the cost of achieving the goal along a consistent path, and introduce a planning algorithm that uses paths as decomposition backbones. The resulting planner, called C3, is not complete and does not perform as well as recent planners that carry extensive but extremely efficient searches such as LAMA, but is competitive with FF and in particular, with FF running in EHC mode which yields very focused but incomplete searches, and thus provides, a more apt comparison. Moreover, many domains are solved backtrack-free, with no search at all, suggesting that planning with paths may be a meaningful idea both cognitively and computationally.","tags":null,"title":"Inference and decomposition in planning using causal consistent chains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nir Lipovetzky","Héctor Geffner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"baec01320e31dc37f3f30215656992a4","permalink":"https://nirlipo.github.io/publication/lipovetzky-2009-path/","publishdate":"2020-07-26T09:42:49.080031Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lipovetzky-2009-path/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Path-based heuristic (preliminary version)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nir Lipovetzky","Miquel Ramirez","Héctor Geffner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"2d71e0e7496572e39450937134ff051b","permalink":"https://nirlipo.github.io/publication/lipovetzky-2008-c-3/","publishdate":"2020-07-26T09:42:49.079019Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lipovetzky-2008-c-3/","section":"publication","summary":"The automatic derivation of informative heuristic functions has been a key development in modern domainindependent planning. Heuristic functions provide the search for plans with a sense of direction that allows large problems to be solved quite effectively. Heuristic search planners, on the other hand, are not transparent: it is not clear why and when they will work, it is not simple to explain, as humans do, why certain actions are selected and others are discarded, and most important of all, it is not simple to improve them in spite of their known limitations. The C3 planner approaches the problem of inference in planning from a different perspective. Rather than relying on the extraction and use of heuristic functions or reductions into SAT or CSPs, C3 prunes’ bad actions’ by appealing to the notion of consistent causal chains (Lipovetzky, Ramirez, and Geffner 2008).","tags":null,"title":"C3: Planning with consistent causal chains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nir Lipovetzky","Miquel Ramırez","Hector Geffner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"d0b2c596757d5cecf429931d1bef6dc3","permalink":"https://nirlipo.github.io/publication/lipovetzky-2008-structural/","publishdate":"2020-07-26T09:42:49.077921Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lipovetzky-2008-structural/","section":"publication","summary":"The aim of this paper is to introduce a different approach to the problem of inference in planning that is not based on either the extraction and use of heuristic functions or reductions into SAT or CSPs. The proposed approach is based on the new notion of consistent causal chains: sequences of causal links ai, pi+ 1, ai+ 1 starting with an action a0 applicable in the current state s and finishing in the goal, where pi+ 1 is an effect of action ai and a precondition of action ai+ 1. We show that by enforcing the semantics of causal links, it is possible to propagate side effects along such chains and detect that some of these chains cannot be part of any plan. Actions a0 that cannot start any consistent causal chain can then be pruned. We show that while simple, this pruning rule is quite powerful: a plain backtracking forward-state search planner with a version of this pruning rule solves as many benchmark problems as the effective Enforced Hill Climbing search of FF, many of them backtrack-free. We then consider extensions of this basic idea and discuss some of its implications.","tags":null,"title":"Structural Inference in Planning: Scaling up without Heuristic Estimators","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f7659a1b0a20b1c9a460b236765ec324","permalink":"https://nirlipo.github.io/project/lapkt/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/lapkt/","section":"project","summary":"Lightweight Automated Planning ToolKiT (LAPKT) to build, use or extend basic to advanced Automated Planners","tags":["AI Planning"],"title":"LAPKT","type":"project"}]
