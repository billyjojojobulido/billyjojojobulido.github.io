Planimation is a modular and extensible open source framework to visualise sequential solutions of planning problems specified in PDDL. We introduce a preliminary declarative PDDL-like animation profile specification, expressive enough to synthesise animations of arbitrary initial states and goals of a benchmark with just a single profile.

## Overview 

Planimation was developed as a final year project by students at the Univeristy of Melbourne. Here's a promotional video explaining the motivation behind planimation.

Planimation is an open-source program which visualises solutions to Planning Problems. It is an executable Unity architecture in a browser.
